To deploy PHP donwload XAMPP. 

XAMPP is an open source package that is widely used for PHP development. XAMPP contains MariaDB, PHP, and Perl; it provides a graphical interface for SQL (phpMyAdmin), making it easy to maintain data in a relational database.

If you have not installed XAMPP, please refer to XAMPP-setup to install and set up XAMPP.

Assuming that you have already set up XAMPP

Start the PHP environment ("Apache Web Server")
Reminder: be sure to stop the server when you are done. Leaving the servers running consumes energy and may later prevent the servers from starting.

Deploy a PHP app
The project is in a folder named PlantWebsite,
inside of  XAMPP/htdocs/ directory to access the app
Be sure to start your web server. To access your app, open a web browser and enter a URL 
    http://localhost/PlantWebsite/home.php
